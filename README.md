# HTML Forms

This is the [HTML Forms project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css).

The basic appearance of [Mailchimp's registration form](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/) was cloned using just HTML and CSS.
